# Machine Learning and Statistics for Physicists

Material adapted from David Kirkby's course, maintained on [github](github.com/dkirkby/MachineLearningStatistics) and distributed under a [BSD3 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

[Table of contents](notebooks/Contents.ipynb)

The notebooks contain exercises but you will need to enable the [exercise2 extension](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/exercise2) to hide the solutions while you work on them, as described in the [setup instructions](notebooks/Setup.ipynb). All solutions are visible if you view notebooks on github.

Instructors are welcome to contact dkirkby at uci.edu for access to additional material or to discuss collaboration.
